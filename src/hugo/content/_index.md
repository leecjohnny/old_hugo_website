## Hi! Welcome! I'm Johnny.

Currently, I am a MBA candidate at [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu). 

Previously, I was a data scientist on the Analytics team at [23andMe](https://23andme.com), focusing on product analytics and strategy.

Prior to 23andMe, I worked on the Business Operations team at [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com), solving data problems at scale for the 10,000+ direct sales force.

Otherwise, I like traveling the world, learning about the latest business trends, and volunteering in my community (check out [YCore](https://ycore.org)!).
